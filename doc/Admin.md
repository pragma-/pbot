## Logging in and out
You cannot use any of the admin commands unless you login. Note that the [`login`](#login) command requires that your currently
connected IRC hostmask matches the hostmask configured for the user account.

You can keep your user account permanently logged in by setting a couple of [user metadata](#user-metadata-list) values. See
the [user metadata list](#user-metadata-list) for more information.

### login
Logs into PBot.

Usage:  `login [channel] <password>`

### logout
Logs out of PBot.

Usage: `logout`

## User management commands
### useradd
Adds a new user to PBot.

Usage: `useradd <username> <hostmasks> [channels [capabilities [password]]]`

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`username` | A unique name to identify this account (usually the `nick` of the user, but it can be any identifier).
`hostmasks` | The hostmasks from which this user is recognized/allowed to login from (e.g., `somenick!*@*.somedomain.com` or `*!*@unaffiliated/someuser`). Can be a comma-separated list of values.
`channels` | The channels this user belongs to; use `global` for all channels. Can be a comma-separated list of values.
`capabilities` | A comma-separated list of [user-capabilities](#user-capabilities) for this user.
`password` | The password the user will use to login (from `/msg`, obviously). Generates a random password if omitted. Users may view and set their password by using the [`my`](Commands.md#my) command.

### userdel
Removes a user from PBot.

Usage: `userdel <username>`

### userset
Sets [metadata](#user-metadata-list) or [user-capabilities](#user-capabilities-list) for a user account. See also: [user metadata list](#user-metadata-list).

If `key` is omitted, it will list all the keys and values that are set.  If `value` is omitted, it will show the value for `key`.

Usage: `userset <username> [<key> [value]]`

### userunset
Deletes a [metadata](#user-metadata-list) or [user-capability](#user-capabilities-list) from a user account.

Usage: `userunset <username> <key>`

#### User metadata list
This is a list of recognized metadata keys for user accounts.

Name | Description
--- | ---
`hostmasks` | A comma-separated list of hostmasks this user is recognized by.
`channels` | A comma-separated list of channels this user belongs to.
`password` | The password for the user account.
`loggedin` | Whether the user is logged in or not.
`stayloggedin` | Do not log the user out when they part/quit.
`autologin` | Automatically log the user in when they join the channel. *Note: make sure the user account's hostmask wildcards are as restrictive as possible.*
`autoop` | Give the user `operator` status when they join the channel. *Note: make sure the user account's hostmask wildcards are as restrictive as possible.*
`autovoice` | Give the user `voiced` status when they join the channel. *Note: make sure the user account's hostmask wildcards are as restrictive as possible.*
`location` | Sets your location for using the [`weather`](Commands.md#weather) command without any arguments.
`timezone` | Sets your timezone for using the [`date`](Commands.md#date) command without any arguments.
`notyposub` | Disallows `s///` typo substitutions.
[capabilities](#user-capabilities-list) | [User-capabilities](#user-capabilities) are managed as user metadata.

### Listing users
To list user accounts, use the `users` command. This is not an admin command, but
it is included here for completeness. Users with a plus (+) sign next their name have
[user-capabilities](#user-capabilities) set on their account.

Usage: `users [channel]`

When the optional `[channel]` argument is provided, only users for that channel
will be listed; no global users will be listed.

When `[channel]` is omitted and the command is used in a channel, it will list
the users for that channel, plus all global users.

When `[channel]` is omitted and the command is used from private message, it will
list all users from all channels, including global users.

## User capabilities
PBot uses a user-capability system to control what users can and cannot do. User-capabilities
provides fine-grained permissions over various PBot functionality.

### Introduction
For example, imagine a user named alice. alice has no capabilities granted yet.
She tries to use the [`ban`](#banmute) command:

    <alice> !ban somebody
     <PBot> The ban command requires the can-ban capability, which your user account does not have.

Suppose alice tries to grant herself the can-ban capability:

    <alice> !my can-ban 1
     <PBot> The can-ban metadata requires the can-modify-capabilities capability, which your user account does not have.

To grant her the `can-ban` capability, a user with the `can-userset` and `can-modifiy-capabilities` capabilities
can use the [`userset`](#userset) command:

    <bob> !userset alice can-ban 1

Now alice can use the `ban` command.

Let's consider the [`mode`](#mode) command. Channel operators can use their IRC client's `/mode` command to
set any channel modes, including any undesirable modes (such as +k). Suppose you'd prefer to limit
their modes to just a specific subset of all modes. You can do this with user-cabilities. To do so,
instead of making them channel operators you can make them PBot users and grant them specific PBot
user-capabilities.

First grant the user the `can-mode` capability so they can use the PBot [`mode`](#mode) command. Then grant them the specific
`can-mode-<flag>` capabilities. To allow them to set any modes without restriction, grant them the `can-mode-any`
capability.

See this demonstration:

    <alice> !mode +b test
     <PBot> The mode command requires the can-mode capability, which your user account does not have.
      <bob> !userset alice can-mode 1
    <alice> !mode +b test
     <PBot> Your user account does not have the can-mode-b capability required to set this mode.
      <bob> !userset alice can-mode-b 1
    <alice> !mode +b test
          * PBot sets mode +b test!*@*
    <alice> !mode +k lol
     <PBot> Your user account does not have the can-mode-k capability required to set this mode.

As you can see, user-capabilities can be very flexible and very powerful in configuring your
channel users. Check out [grouping capabilities](#grouping-capabilities) in the upcoming section
of this document, as well. Read on!

### cap
Use the `cap` command to list capabilities, to manage capability groups and to
see what capabilities a user has.

Usage:

    cap list [capability] |
    cap group <existing or new capability group> <existing capabilities...> |
    cap ungroup <existing capability group> <grouped capability> |
    cap userhas <user> [capability] |
    cap whohas <capability>

#### Listing capabilities
Use `cap list [capability]` to list user-capabilities.

If `[capability]` is omitted, the command will list all available capabilities.

    <pragma-> cap list
       <PBot> Capabilities: admin (25 caps), botowner (71 caps), can-ban (1 cap), can-deop (1 cap),
              can-devoice (1 cap), can-mode-any (53 caps), can-mute (1 cap), can-op (1 cap), can-unban (1 cap),
              can-unmute (1 cap), can-voice (1 cap), chanmod (4 caps), chanop (10 caps), moderator (4 caps),
              can-actiontrigger, can-akalink, can-akaunlink, can-antispam, can-blacklist, ...


#### Grouping capabilities
Capabilities can be grouped together into a collection, which can then be applied to a user.
Capability groups can contain nested groups.

In the [listing capabilities](#listing-capabilities) example, the `admin` capability is
a group containing several capabilities, including other grouped capabilites such as the `chanop` capability
group which itself can contain more groups and capabilities.

Observe.

    <pragma-> cap list admin
       <PBot> Grouped capabilities for admin: can-mode-any (53 caps), chanop (10 caps),
              can-actiontrigger, can-akalink, can-akaunlink, can-antispam, can-blacklist,
              can-chanlist, can-clear-bans, can-clear-mutes, can-countertrigger, can-ignore,
              can-in, can-join, can-kick-wildcard, can-mode, can-op-wildcard, can-part,
              can-unignore, can-useradd, can-userdel, can-userset, can-userunset, can-voice-wildcard
<!-- -->
    <pragma-> cap list chanop
       <PBot> Grouped capabilities for chanop: can-ban (1 cap), can-deop (1 cap), can-devoice (1 cap),
              can-mute (1 cap), can-op (1 cap), can-unban (1 cap), can-unmute (1 cap), can-voice (1 cap),
              can-invite, can-kick
<!-- -->
    <pragma-> cap list can-ban
       <PBot> Grouped capabilities for can-ban: can-mode-b

##### Creating a new group or adding to an existing group
To create a new capability group or to add capabilities to an existing group,
use the `cap group` command.

Usage: `cap group <existing or new capability group> <existing capabilities...>`

For example, to create a new capability group called `moderator` who can strictly
only set `mode +m` or `mode -m` and use the `voice` and `devoice` commands:

    <pragma-> cap group moderator can-voice can-devoice can-mode can-mode-m
<!-- -->
    <pragma-> cap list moderator
       <PBot> Grouped capabilities for moderator: can-devoice (1 cap), can-voice (1 cap),
              can-mode, can-mode-m

Then you can set this capability group on users with the [`userset`](#userset) command.

##### Removing capabilites from a group or deleting a group
To remove capabilities from a group or to delete a group, use the `cap ungroup`
command.

Usage: `cap ungroup <existing capability group> <grouped capability>`

When the last capability is removed from a group, the group itself will be deleted.

#### Giving capabilities to users
To give capabilities to a user, use the [`useradd`](#useradd) or the [`userset`](#userset) commands.

    <pragma-> useradd alice global alice!*@* moderator

or

    <pragma-> userset alice moderator 1

#### Checking user capabilities
To see what capabilities a user account has, use the `cap userhas` command.

Usage: `cap userhas <user> [capability]`

If the `[capability]` argument is omitted, the command will list all capability
groups and capabilities the user account has.

If the `[capability]` argument is provided, the command will determine if the
capability is granted to the user account.

    <pragma-> cap userhas alice
       <PBot> User alice has capabilities: moderator (4 caps)
<!-- -->
    <pragma-> cap userhas alice can-voice
       <PBot> Yes. User alice has capability can-voice.
<!-- -->
    <pragma-> cap userhas alice can-op
       <PBot> No. User alice does not have capability can-op.

#### Listing users who have a capability
To list all the users that have a capability, use the `cap whohas` command.

Usage: `cap whohas <capability>`

    <pragma-> cap whohas moderator
       <PBot> Users with capability moderator: alice
<!-- -->
    <pragma-> cap whohas can-voice
       <PBot> Users with capability can-voice: alice

#### User capabilities list
This is a list of built-in capability groups and capabilities. You can create
new custom capability groups with the [`cap group`](#creating-a-new-group-or-adding-to-an-existing-group) command.

Please note that PBot is sometimes updated more frequently than this list is updated. To see the most
current list of capabilities, use the [`cap list`](#listing-capabilities) command or see the
[`data/capabilities`](../data/capabilities) file.

Name | Description | Belongs to group
--- | --- | ---
`botowner` | The most powerful capability group. Contains all capabilities.| none
`admin` | The admin capability group. Contains the basic administrative capabilities. | botowner

`can-<command name>` | If a command `<command name>` has the `cap-required` [command metadata](#command-metadata-list) then the user's account must have the `can-<command name>` capability to invoke it. For example, the [`op`](#op) command requires users to have the `can-op` capability. | botowner, various groups
`can-mode-<flag>` | Allows the [`mode`](#mode) command to set mode `<flag>`. For example, to allow a user to set `mode +m` give them the `can-mode` and `can-mode-m` capabilities. `<flag>` is one mode character. | botowner, can-mode-any
`can-mode-any` | Allows the [`mode`](#mode) command to set any mode flag. | botowner
`can-modify-admins` | Allows the user to modify user accounts that have the `admin` capability | botowner
`can-modify-capabilities` | Allows the user to use the [`useradd`](#useradd) or [`userset`](#userset) commands to add or remove capabilities from users. | botowner
`can-group-capabilities` | Allows the user to use the [`cap group`](#cap) and [`cap ungroup`](#cap) commands to modify capability groups. | botowner
`can-clear-bans` | Allows the user to use [`unban *`](#unbanunmute) to clear a channel's bans. | botowner, admin
`can-clear-mutes` | Allows the user to use [`unmute *`](#unbanunmute) to clear a channel's mutes. | botowner, admin
`can-kick-wildcard` | Allows the user to use wildcards with the [`kick`](#kick) command. | botowner, admin
`can-op-wildcard` | Allows the user to use wildcards with the [`op`](#op) command. | botowner, admin
`can-voice-wildcard` | Allows the user to use wildcards with the [`voice`](#voice) command. | botowner, admin, chanop, chanmod
`is-whitelisted` | The user is exempt from anti-flood, ban-evasion checks, wild-card kicking, etc. | botowner, admin, chanop

## Channel management commands
### join
To temporarily join a channel, use the `join` command. The channels may be a comma-
separated list.

Usage: `join <channel(s)>`

### part
To temporarily leave a channel (that is, without removing it from PBot's list
of channels), use the `part` command. The channels may be a comma-separated
list.

Usage `part <channel(s)>`

### chanadd
`chanadd` permanently adds a channel to PBot's list of channels to auto-join and manage.

Usage: `chanadd <channel>`

### chanrem
`chanrem` removes a channel from PBot's list of channels to auto-join and manage.

Usage: `chanrem <channel>`

### chanset
`chanset` sets a channel's metadata. See [channel metadata list](#channel-metadata-list)

Usage: `chanset <channel> [key [value]]`

If both `key` and `value` are omitted, chanset will show all the keys and values for that channel. If only `value` is omitted, chanset will show the value for that key.

### chanunset
`chanunset` deletes a channel's metadata key.

Usage: `chanunset <channel> <key>`

### chanlist
`chanlist` lists all added channels and their metadata keys and values.

#### Channel metadata list
Name | Description
--- | ---
`enabled` | When set to a true value, PBot will auto-join this channel after identifying to NickServ (unless `general.autojoin_wait_for_nickserv` is `0`, in which case auto-join happens immediately).
`chanop` | When set to a true value, PBot will perform channel management (anti-flooding, ban-evasion, etc).
`permop` | When set to a true value, PBot will automatically op itself when joining and remain opped instead of automatically opping and deopping as necessary.

### ignore
Ignore a user. If you omit `[channel]` PBot will ignore the user in all channels, including private messages.

Usage: `ignore <hostmask regex> [channel [timeout]]`

Timeout can be specified as an relative time in English; for instance, `5 minutes`, `1 month and 2 weeks`, `next thursday`, `friday after next`, `forever` and such.

### unignore
Unignores a user. If you omit `[channel]` PBot will unignore the user from all channels, including private messages.

Usage:  `unignore <hostmask regex> [channel]`

### blacklist
Blacklists a hostmask regex from joining a channel.

Usages:

- `blacklist <show/list>`
- `blacklist add <hostmask regex> [channel]`
- `blacklist remove <hostmask regex> [channel]`

### op
### deop
### voice
### devoice
The `op`, `deop`, `voice` and `devoice` commands all perform their respective named action.

The `targets` parameter can be a list of multiple nicks, optionally containing
wildcards. If `targets` is omitted, the action will be performed on the caller.

Usages:

In channel:

* `op [targets]`
* `deop [targets]`
* `voice [targets]`
* `devoice [targets]`

From private message:

* `op <channel> [targets]`
* `deop <channel> [targets]`
* `voice <channel> [targets]`
* `devoice <channel> [targets]`

### mode
Sets or unsets channel or user modes.

Usage: `mode [channel] <flags> [targets]`

PBot extends the IRC `MODE` command in useful ways. For instance, the `targets`
parameter may contain wildcards. To op everybody whose nick ends with `|dev` you
can do `!mode +o *|dev` in a channel.

### ban/mute
Bans or mutes a user. If the argument is a nick instead of a hostmask, it will determine an appropriate banmask for that nick.
The argument can be a comma-separated list of multiple nicks or masks.

Usages:
- `ban <nick or hostmask> [channel [timeout]]`
- `mute <nick or hostmask> [channel [timeout]]`

If `timeout` is omitted, PBot will ban the user for 24 hours. Timeout can be specified as an relative time in English; for instance, `5 minutes`, `1 month and 2 weeks`, `next thursday`, `friday after next`, `forever` and such.

### unban/unmute
Unbans or unmutes a user. If the argument is a nick instead of a hostmask, it will find all bans that match any of that nick's hostmasks or NickServ accounts and unban them.
The argument can be a comma-separated list of multiple nicks or masks. If the argument is `*` then all bans/mutes for the channel will be removed.

Usages:
- `unban <nick or hostmask> [channel]`
- `unmute <nick or hostmask> [channel]`

### invite
Invites a user to a channel.

Usage: `invite [channel] <nick>`

### kick
Removes a user from the channel. `<nick>` can be a comma-separated list of multiple users, optionally containing wildcards. If `[reason]` is omitted, a random insult will be used.

Usage from channel:   `kick <nick> [reason]`
From private message: `kick <channel> <nick> [reason]`

## Module management commands
Note that modules are "reloaded" each time they are executed. There is no need to `refresh` after editing a module.

### load
This command loads a module in `$data_dir/modules/` as a PBot command. It is
equivalent to `factadd`ing a new keyword and then setting its `type` to `module`.

Usage: `load <keyword> <module>`

For example, to load `$data_dir/modules/qalc.sh` as the `qalc` command:

    <pragma-> !load qalc qalc.sh

### unload
This command unloads a module. It is equivalent to deleting the factoid keyword
the module was loaded as.

Usage: `unload <keyword>`

### Listing modules
To list the loaded modules, use the `list modules` command. This is not an admin command, but
it is included here for completeness.

Usage: `list modules`

## Plugin management commands
### plug
Loads a plugin into PBot.

Usage: `plug <plugin>`

### unplug
Unloads a plugin from PBot.

Usage: `unplug <plugin>`

### replug
Reloads a plugin into PBot. The plugin is first unloaded and then it is loaded again.

Usage: `replug <plugin>`

### pluglist
Lists all currently loaded plugins. This isn't an admin command, but it is included here for completeness.

Usage: `pluglist`

    <pragma-> !pluglist
       <PBot> Loaded plugins: ActionTrigger, AntiAway, AntiKickAutoRejoin, AntiNickSpam,
              AntiRepeat, AntiTwitter, AutoRejoin, Battleship, Connect4, Counter, Date,
              GoogleSearch, Quotegrabs, RemindMe, RestrictedMod, Spinach, TypoSub, UrlTitles,
              Weather, Wolfram, Wttr

## Command metadata commands
### cmdset
Use `cmdset` to set various [metadata](#command-metadata-list) for built-in commands.

Usage: `cmdset <command> [key [value]]`

Omit `<key>` and `<value>` to list all the keys and values for a command.  Specify `<key>`, but omit `<value>` to see the value for a specific key.

### cmdunset
Use `cmdunset` to delete various [metadata](#command-metadata-list) from built-in commands.

Usage: `cmdunset <command> <key>`

### Command metadata list
Name | Description
--- | ---
`help` | The text to display for the [`help`](Commands.md#help) command.
`cap-required` | When set to a true value then the command requires that users have the `can-<command name>` [capability](#user-capabilities) before they can invoke it.
`dont-replace-pronouns` | When set to a true value then pronouns such as "my", "me", "your", etc, will not be intuitively replaced with nicks and such.
`background-process` | When set to a true value then this command will be executed as a background process. Use this for commands that can potentially take a long time to complete.
`process-timeout` | The timeout, in seconds, before the process is automatically killed. If not set then the `processmanager.default_timeout` [registry](Registry.md) value will be used.

## Event queue management
### eventqueue
PBot uses an event queue to schedule future tasks or commands. The `eventqueue` command can
be used to list or remove upcoming events. It can also be used to schedule a command.

Usage: `eventqueue list [filter regex] | add <relative time> <command> [-repeat] | remove <event>`

For example, to schedule a command to run 1 hour from now:

    <pragma-> eventqueue add "1 hour" echo Ta-da!
       <PBot> Command added to event queue.

    <pragma-> eventqueue list
       <PBot> Queued events: 1) in 1h: command #channel echo Ta-da!

    ... 1 hour later ...

       <PBot> Ta-da!

The `remove` command's `<event>` argument can include wildcards. For example,
to remove all `command` events:

    <pragma-> eventqueue remove command *
       <PBot> Removed 1 event.

Or to remove all `command` events in `#channel`:

    <pragma-> eventqueue remove command #channel *

## Process management commands
### ps
Lists all currently running background processes.

Usage: `Usage: ps [-atu]`

Option | Description
--- | ---
`-a` | show all information
`-t` | show running time
`-u` | show user and channel

### kill
Sends the interrupt signal to selected running background processes.

Usage: `Usage: kill [-a] [-t <seconds>] [-s <signal>] [pids...]`

Option | Description
--- | ---
`-a` | kill all processes
`-t <seconds>` | kill processes running longer than `<seconds>`
`-s <signal>` | send `<signal>` to processes instead of interrupt signal
`pids...` | space-delimited list of PIDs to kill

If neither options `-a` or `-t` are provided then the `pids...` option is required.

## Miscellaneous commands
These are some of the miscellaneous admin commands that have not been covered
above or in the rest of the PBot documentation.

### export
Exports specified list to HTML file in `$data_dir`.

Usage:  `export <factoids|quotegrabs>`

### refresh
Refreshes/reloads PBot core modules and plugins (not the command-line modules since those are executed/loaded each time they are invoked).

For example, suppose you edit some PBot source file, be it a core file such as PBot/Factoids.pm or
a Plugin such as Plugins/Wttr.pm. Rather than shut the bot down and restart it, you can simply use
the `refresh` command to reload all modified PBot core files and Plugins.

### reload
Reloads a data or configuration file from `$data_dir`. This is useful if you
manually edit a data or configuration file and you want PBot to know about the
modifications.

Usage `reload <admins|bantimeouts|blacklist|channels|factoids|funcs|ignores|mutetimeouts|registry>`

### sl
Sends a raw IRC command to the server. Use the `sl` command when
PBot does not have a built-in command to do what you need.

Usage: `sl <irc command>`

    <pragma-> sl PRIVMSG #channel :Test message
       <PBot> Test message

### die
Tells PBot to disconnect and exit.
