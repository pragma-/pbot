Installation:

If you want to run the compiler inside a virtual machine for more security,
these scripts are designed to work with qemu 0.11.1.  This is required in
order to use PBot's trigger.  

In addition, you can use the provided 'cc' script to use your local compiler tools
without installing qemu.  No PBot installation or configuration is required in this case.

To use the local non-vm 'cc' script, you will need to have gcc, gdb and astyle installed locally.

Be aware that you need to single-quote or escape the code if you use the local 'cc' within a shell,
e.g.:  ./cc $'char s[] = "hello, world"; puts(s);  if(s[0] == 'h') puts("true");' 

WARNING: Using the local 'cc' script outside of the virtual machine will not use qemu at all; 
         it will affect local system -- compile "safe" code!

Virtual machine installation:

You will need to download qemu and set up a virtual machine containing a system
with a compiler and, optionally, sensible ulimits/fork-preventation/other security.

1) copy compiler_vm_server.pl and compiler_watchdog.pl to the virtual machine.
2) then start up the compiler_vm_server.pl script inside the virtual machine
3) then connect to qemu's monitor and issue the 'savevm 1' command to save the virtual state
   (After compiles, this state will be loaded via 'loadvm 1' to reset everything within the machine 
    for a clean and working environment for subsequent compiles.)

Now the virtual machine state 1 is saved in a state where it is listening for incoming code.  You can 
go ahead and quit qemu without shutting down the guest operating sytem.

Starting the virtual machine for PBot:

Now that the virtual machine is configured and saved, you may launch the local server to listen for
code from PBot to send to the virtual machine's server.  To do so, run the compiler_server.pl script.

Dependencies:

gcc
gdb
astyle
ulimit -c 50000 (required to produce core files if you wish to have gdb debugger output)

Files:

(Read within each file for configuration instructions.)

- cc: Allows you to use the compiler locally with or without qemu installed.
      Can be used within virtual machine for testing.
      Requires only compiler_vm_client.pl, compiler_vm_server.pl and compiler_watchdog.pl.
      Must have gcc, gdb and astyle installed locally if not used within virtual machine.
      WARNING: If not used within virtual machine will not use qemu at all and will 
               affect local system -- compile "safe" code!

- compiler_client.pl:  Main entry point for compiling snippets.  Sends over TCP to
                       compiler_server.pl.  This file can be run be run from the
                       client machine or anywhere.

- compiler_server.pl:  Responsible for setting up a TCP server to listen for
                       incoming compile requests; and launching and resetting
                       the virtual machine.  Sends to compiler_vm_client.pl.
                       Run this file on the server hosting the virtual machine.

- compiler_vm_client.pl: Responsible for sending snippets to the virtual
                         machine.  Also expands/translates and formats
                         snippets into compilable code (with main function and
                         headers), and handles "interactive-editing".
                         Sends over TCP to qemu serial port, waits for result,
                         then sends result back caller (compiler_server.pl).
                         Run this file on the server hosting the virtual machine.

- compiler_vm_server.pl: Runs on the system inside the virtual machine.
                         This script listens for incoming code snippets over
                         the virtual machine's serial port.
                         Calls compiler_watchdog.pl to monitor its exit signal
                         or exit status, then returns result back over serial
                         port (to compiler_vm_client.pl).

- compiler_watchdog.pl: Runs a program and watches its exit signals/status.
                        Run within the virtual machine.

*** The following files are just auxiliary tools to start/connect to qemu, provided
for convenience only.  Perhaps they will be useful during installation/testing:

- monitor: Connects to qemu monitor (internal console) over TCP.

- serial: Connects to qemu serial port over TCP.

- runqemu: Launches qemu with a visible window, but without networking support.

- runeqmu.net: Launches qemu with a visible window, and with networking support.
               You may load a state previously saved with runqemu and reboot it
               or otherwise reload its networking configuration to gain networking.
